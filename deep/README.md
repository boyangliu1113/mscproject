# deep learning model
This folder is for the deep learning model. The definition of the LSTM network is in Siamese_network_semantic.py. To train the model, simply run python train.py with your customized parameters (like number of epochs, training files, etc.) in the command line of the current directory. To evaluate the model, run eval.py with the required parameters(like the path of the vocabulary of the model and the path of the saved model to be evaluated). There are also two notebooks(for demo-Q_QA.ipynb and for demo.ipynb) parepared to show the output of the QA system which can take any question as the input and output the ranked answer list. Simply run the notebooks from the beginning to the end.
