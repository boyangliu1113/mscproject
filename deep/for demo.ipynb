    "# Why Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The traditional information retrieval way for question answering works very well, especially when you knows what you want exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- But the problem is you need to know what you want exactly, i.e the best key words\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sometimes this is not easy and bring higher requirement to the user\n",
    "\n",
    "- For machine learning methods, you can overcome this problem to some extent, by feature engineering (which can take more aspects into consideration than only mathcing the words) or by state of the art deep learning models (which can automaticly learn the relationship from the dataset) \n",
    "\n",
    "# How?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traditional machine learning models were tested with manually extracted features, which mainly considers the similarity between the question and the answer\n",
    "\n",
    "- Large number of papers related to QA system are looked through. Most of them still using the idea to matching the answer with the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, a deep siamese network model proposed by CS&AI Lab of MIT is applied \n",
    "\n",
    "# The result\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- using similarity between concepts insted of specific term search\n",
    "- Around 70% accuracy to distinguish right answers from the answer set\n",
    "- can take full sentence as the input question and returns the information with a ranked list\n",
    "- overcomes the shortcome of elastic search though not as precise as it\n",
    "- therfore can be a supplement to be used together"

      "\u001b[1;34m\"Is GE data stored in encrypted form? Examples: If storing data in a database, sensitive data should be encrypted within the database. If storing GE data on laptops, the laptops should have full disk encryption installed. If storing GE data in a network share drive, the drive or the folder where the data resides should be encrypted. If storing GE data on a mobile device, the device should be encrypted.\"\u001b[0m\n",
      "Answer: Laptops have full disk encryption as do mobile devices. Existing mitigation: Data on endpoints is encrypted at rest using Microsoft BitLocker. For shared storage in datacenters, data is wide striped across a large number of disks and the disks are mixed data and parity disks which means any one disk only holds fragments of data which the storage array then combines into readable data when requested.  Elements of one file will be cut and striped across a large number of mixed parity disks, e.g. RAID groups contain between 30  and 100  disks. It is not possible to combine the data to obtain meaningful data without having access to A) all disks that hold a particular file and B) the Storage Array which would be required to piece file fragments together.  So in order to obtain usable data one would have to either steal the whole array as is or have sufficient access to work out which disks to steal to form a complete disk aggregate/pool.  For our main CIFS on VNX the data is further protected as the data is wide striped twice on top of each other making it even less likely that anyone stealing one or two disks will be able to get meaningful data out of it.  Obtaining such access would be both extremely difficult and time consuming and given the physical security around our storage arrays is highly unlikely.  Additionally, automated alerts are raised if any disks are removed from the storage arrays, there is CCTV covering datacentre aisles between racks, and for co-location datacenters the storage arrays are in caged areas.  It makes this vector of attack, with the current mechanisms in place, extremely low risk.  Plan: Our global storage refresh & upgrade project has consolidated all storage replacement activity and will implement at-rest encryption by default.  This project is in the final stages of vendor selection and contract agreement.  As the project applies to our core production estate, the plan's timeline for rollout has been set to avoid disruption to clients and will complete by end 2018.   At-rest encryption will be a requirement for all new storage that is procured in the future.\n",
