    "# Why Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The traditional information retrieval way for question answering works very well, especially when you knows what you want exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- But the problem is you need to know what you want exactly, i.e the best key words\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sometimes this is not easy and bring higher requirement to the user\n",
    "\n",
    "- For machine learning methods, you can overcome this problem to some extent, by feature engineering (which can take more aspects into consideration than only mathcing the words) or by state of the art deep learning models (which can automaticly learn the relationship from the dataset) \n",
    "\n",
    "# How?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traditional machine learning models were tested with manually extracted features, which mainly considers the similarity between the question and the answer\n",
    "\n",
    "- Large number of papers related to QA system are looked through. Most of them still using the idea to matching the answer with the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, a deep siamese network model proposed by CS&AI Lab of MIT is applied \n",
    "\n",
    "# The result\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- using similarity between concepts insted of specific term search\n",
    "- Around 70% accuracy to distinguish right answers from the answer set\n",
    "- can take full sentence as the input question and returns the information with a ranked list\n",
    "- overcomes the shortcome of elastic search though not as precise as it\n",
    "- therfore can be a supplement to be used together"

Yes,  The patching procedure requires that patches are to be released to the Wintel server systems within 1  month of release date (using preconfigured \"Server Patching Groups\" set up before the monthly (patch Tuesday) release of security patches by Microsoft). This scheduling is used in order to install security updates to all Wintel servers within the set time frame.  The deployement of patches executued by an software tool which allows for installs and deinstallations.     An Emergency (Out of band) patch release process is used only when an IT and Operational Risk assessment has been completed and is triggered by the criticality of the patch and an existing known threat agent.   \n",
